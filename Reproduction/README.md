# Ecosystem Models from [Carpenter et al., 2015](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/46/14384)

* `R` contains code from Carpenter paper in R: 

* `Python` contains code in Python reproducing the Carpenter results from R (https://github.com/CFL-UWMadison/SOSvariance)

* `Figures` shows figures verifying the codes produce the same results. \\
The time series are the same, but the estimations of the spectra are different.\\
While the magnitudes of the spectra are different, the conclusions about differences in the spectra between management strategies are the same.
